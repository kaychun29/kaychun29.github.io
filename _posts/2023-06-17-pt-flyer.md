A few flyers I made for the Polluted Tongues shows this past month or so. 

For the May show, a certain hater *michael* didn't like the Gordo's mouth version so I had to switch gears to some free oil paintings for the art.

In the June flyer Polluted Tongues provided me the desired background art.. I think it is a version of Satan? Perhaps a demon? You tell me.
